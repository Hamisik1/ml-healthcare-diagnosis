## 🩺 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world healthcare problems — from classifying tumors to evaluating predictions using confusion matrices and model metrics.

Key objectives:
- Train a model to classify tissue samples as benign or malignant
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Visualize predictions to understand model strengths and limitations
- Reflect on healthcare use cases from the Stanford Precision Medicine modules

---

## 🔬 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- seaborn & matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (hosted on Kaggle)
- AWS (Cloud Practitioner & Solutions Architect knowledge applied)

---

## 📌 Key ML Concepts Covered

- Supervised classification
- Model training/testing split (80/20)
- Confusion matrix interpretation
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Real-world impact of false positives and false negatives in medicine
